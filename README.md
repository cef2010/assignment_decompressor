# assignment_decompressor

This is a simple .rb script that will unpack Canvas submissions downloaded for a specific assignment and place them into folders for each student. To run, put the `submissions.zip` file inside the root directory for this repo, adjacent to `/students` and `assignment_unzip.rb`. In your terminal, run `ruby assignment_unzip.rb`.
